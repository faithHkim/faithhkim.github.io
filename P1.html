  PROMPT
</p>
<p class="words">
Based off of the Air France 447 accident, this project
revolved around the obvious need for improvement in the
flight deck design. There is more than one way of showing
how a plane is flying and faring in external conditions.
On top of that, its important for a pilot to know how the
plane is flying in relationship to its flight envelope,
which can indicate future stalling or further negative
conditions. I sought to create a display that provided
clear visual cues in safe and unsafe conditions.
</p>

  <p class="subtitles">PROCESS</p>
<p class="words">
  We started by learning the mechanics a plane and how it flies.
   We heavily investigated and picked apart the Air France accident,
   where the nose of a commercial plane was mistakenly pointed to far up.
   This caused the plane to stall, and eventually leading to many deaths.
   While there was a definite lack of communication between the pilots,
   the flight display could have improved the situation with better visual
   communication. We then studied the Three Mile Island Accident, that had
   a similar issue of operators failing to recognize the situation and act
   accordingly. The class did a lot of research and analysis before even
   starting to design a new flight deck. I soon found that understanding
   the fundamentals of a simple interaction was an important factor, as
   I started to design.</p>

   <p class="subtitles">FINAL SOLUTION</p>
   <p class="words">
     my final solution involved a horizontal view of a plane and a ghost
     plane counterpart. During a groupthink session, my group members and
     I were inspired by video games, like Dance Dance Revolution and Mario
     kart. These games had components where the player either had a bird’s
     eye view or motions that were coming next. Taking that into the context
     of a plane, I decided to bring in a ghost plane to illustrate the future
     path of the plane and the necessary steps to get there. The ghost plane
     functions with speed, altitude and angle optimizations that essentially
     tell the pilot how much to increase or decrease each in order to be on
      the ghost plane’s path.</p>
